## The Refactoring Tales

### javascriptplayground.com/the-refactoring-tales/

---

## Building web sites with NodeJS and ExpressJS

### 2014.webdevconf.com

---

## Refactoring

### Changing the design of the code _without_ changing the functionality

---

## Code Smells

- duplication
- magic values
- long methods
- bad use of the library
- lots of arguments to a method
- shotgun surgery
- large switch / if else statements

---

## The Goal

### Over time, requirements change, and code will have to change. Those changes should be easy.
